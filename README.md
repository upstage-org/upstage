UpStage is a platform for cyberformance - remote players combine digital media in real-time for an online audience. All you need is a web browser!

In 2020, as part of the Mobilise/Demobilise project, UpStage is getting a complete rebuild. We are removing its dependency on Flash so that it will function on mobile devices, and making numerous enhancements. Please star the repository and join the team - all contributors welcome!
